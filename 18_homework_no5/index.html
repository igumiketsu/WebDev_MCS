		 		<p class="p-col1">Kindly note, that all appointments to the visa center are free of charge. Appointment confirmation must be printed out and presented at VMS visa center. Documents can be submitted not earlier than 90 days before the trip. In case of submitting documents for a group it is necessary to make one appointment for the entire group including minors and pay the visa fee by one receipt. Due to security reasons we do not allow applicants to be accompanied with friends, relatives or acquaintances. However, one family member is allowed to accompany hearing-impaired / physically challenged / minors applicants.</p>
